Check-FlashDrive.ps1 is designed to be a script that runs at user logoff in multi-user computer environments like labs and classrooms. Checks for USB removable storage devices plugged into the computer. If any are found, the speakers play a reminder and a popup message appears on the screen prompting the user to check for a flash drive they may have forgotten to unplug.
